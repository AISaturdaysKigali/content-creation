## Content Creation

# Making videos

- **Make sure your slides don't use any copyrighted material.** For example, we can't include figures from journals if they are not open access.

# Making tutorials

- Code standards/notebook examples for ML and DL can be found in [AI6Kigali_Tutorial_Format][tutorial-format] notebook.
- Code standards (specifically) for exercises within tutorials can be found in [AI6Kigali_DL_Exercise_Format][exercise-format] notebook.
- If you want a particular interactive demo but don't know how to make it, reach out! We can help.
- Once you finish the tutorials, we will review them and give you feedback for updates.
